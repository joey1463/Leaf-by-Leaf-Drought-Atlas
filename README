"Stress drives plasticity in leaf maturation transcriptional dynamics." bioRxiv (2025): 2025-02.

All code is written in R and is organized into 34 scripts, executed sequentially from Script 1 to Script 34.
Each script performs a specific stage of the analysis pipeline, and scripts depend on outputs generated by earlier ones. Begin with Script 1 and proceed in numerical order.
Datasets associated with this project are publicly available at GEO (GSE290214).
